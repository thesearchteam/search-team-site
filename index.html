      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We are a grassroots volunteer team deploying thermal drones and expert search personnel to locate Jack and Lilly Sullivan, missing from Pictou County, Nova Scotia. Our mission is to use modern tools where traditional searches struggle, and to keep hope alive.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tech">
      <h2>How We Search</h2>
      <p>Using drones equipped with thermal imaging and AI-assisted footage analysis, we can scan large wooded areas quickly and accurately — day or night — helping to spot heat signatures and terrain disturbances that are invisible to the naked eye.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>The official search has paused. The terrain is vast and difficult. But Jack and Lilly are still missing. We believe technology and persistence can make the difference. We are continuing the search independently — and we need your help to keep going.</p>
